### song beats per minute detection

This small project for detecting the beats per minute of a song is based on the algorithm described [here](http://tech.beatport.com/2014/web-audio/beat-detection-using-web-audio/), using the WebAudio API. We also use the Spotify API to get the 30-second song preview clips.

There is also a `Procfile` for easy [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) deployment.
